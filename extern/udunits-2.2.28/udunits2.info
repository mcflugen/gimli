1 Introduction
**************

The UDUNITS-2 package provides support for units of physical quantities.
Its three main components are: 1) *note a C library: (udunits2lib)Top.
for units of physical quantities; 2) *note a utility:
(udunits2prog)Top.; for obtaining the definition of a unit and for
converting numeric values between compatible units; and 3) an *note
extensive database of units: Database.

2 How This Package Differs from the Original 'UDUNITS' Package
**************************************************************

The 'UDUNIT-2' package differs from the 'UDUNITS-1' package in the
following ways:

   * *Support for non-ASCII characters:* The 'UDUNITS-1' package only
     supports the ASCII character set.  The 'UDUNITS-2' package supports
     the following character sets: ASCII, ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1), and the
     UTF-8 encoding of ISO 10646 (Unicode).  This means that unit string
     specifications like "'µ°F·Ω⁻¹'" are now supported (your
     viewer must support UTF-8 to display this string correctly).

   * *Support for logarithmic units:* The unit string specification
     "'0.1 lg(re 1 mW)'" specifies a deciBel unit with a one milliwatt
     reference level.  Such units are fully integrated into the package
     and all meaningful operations and conversions are supported.

   * *Persistent value converters:* It is now possible to obtain a
     _converter_ data-object, which can be used to convert numeric
     values in one unit to numeric values in another, compatible unit.
     The values can be 'float', 'double', or one-dimensional arrays of
     'float's or 'double's.

   * *Improved API:* Due to the above changes, it was not possible to
     keep the application programming interface (API) of the 'UDUNITS-1'
     package.  The new interface, however, is easily understood and easy
     to use.  To support backward comptibility, the package does contain
     a version 1 C API, which uses the version 2 library.

   * *XML unit database:* The unit database is encoded using
     human-readable XML rather than a custom format.  The XML parser
     included in the package supports an _<import>_ element to allow
     easy and convenient customization.

   * *No Fortran or Perl API:* Interfaces for these languages have not
     yet been created.  Contact <support-udunits@unidata.ucar.edu> if
     you are interested in helping to create these interfaces.

   One thing that has not changed is that almost all unit string
specifications understood by the 'UDUNITS-1' package are also understood
by the 'UDUNITS-2' package.  One exception is the symbol 'g', which in
version 1 of the package was associated with standard free fall (a unit
of acceleration) but which is associated with the unit gram in version 2
of the package.

3.1 Prerequisites for This Package
==================================

The Expat library and header-files must be installed.  Look for the
library "libexpat" and the header-file "expat.h".

   If this package is to be tested (which is optional), then the CUnit
library and header-files must be installed.  Look for the library
"libcunit" and the header-files "CUnit/CUnit.h" and "CUnit/Basic.h".

   If this package is to be built on a Windows system, then the CMake
and MinGW packages must be installed.  Look for the utility "cmake" and
the directory/folder "MinGW".


File: udunits2.info,  Node: Binary,  Next: Source,  Prev: Prerequisites,  Up: Installation

3.2 Installing from a Binary Distribution
=========================================

Currently, only an RPM binary distribution is supported.

   Download the distribution by browsing to the Unidata UDUNITS RPM
repository at
<https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/service/rest/repository/browse/rpm-udunits/udunits/>
or by executing, for example, the following commands:
     cd ~/Downloads
     wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/repository/rpm-udunits/udunits/udunits-2.2.28-x86_64.rpm

   Install the distribution.  For example,
     sudo rpm --install [--prefix=/opt/udunits] ~/Downloads/udunits-2.2.28-x86_64.rpm
   where the argument in square brackets is optional.  The default
installation directory is '/usr/local'.

3.3 Installing from a Source Distribution
=========================================

* Windows::  Building and installing in Windows environments


File: udunits2.info,  Node: Unix,  Next: Windows,  Up: Source

3.3.1 Installing from source on Unix
------------------------------------

Download the source by browsing to the Unidata UDUNITS source repository
at
<https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/service/rest/repository/browse/downloads-udunits/>
or by executing, for example, the following commands:
     cd ~/Downloads
     curl -O https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/repository/downloads-udunits/udunits-2.2.28.tar.gz

   Unpack the distribution in an appropriate place.  For example,
     cd /opt
     sudo pax -rz < ~/Downloads/udunits-2.2.28.tar.gz

   Build and install the package.  For example
     cd udunits2-2.2.28
     ./configure [--prefix=INSTALL_PREFIX] >&configure.log
     make all [check] install [install-html] [install-pdf]
   where the arguments in square brackets are optional.  The default
installation prefix is the parent directory of the source directory.


File: udunits2.info,  Node: Windows,  Prev: Unix,  Up: Source

3.3.2 Installing from source on Windows
---------------------------------------

Download the source by browsing to the Unidata UDUNITS source repository
at
<https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/service/rest/repository/browse/downloads-udunits/>
or by executing, for example, the following commands:
     cd C:\Users\CURRENT_USER\Downloads
     curl -O https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/repository/downloads-udunits/udunits-2.2.28.zip

   Unpack the distribution by opening the downloaded file and extracting
the contents to, for example, the user's "Downloads" folder.  Note that,
by default, the extractor might create an extra top-level folder with a
duplicate name.  Remove the extra folder from the destination path if
this is the case - either before or after extraction.

   Build and install the package using cmake(1).  For example
     cd C:\Users\CURRENT_USER\Downloads\udunits2-2.2.28
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake [-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=INSTALL_PREFIX] ..
     make all install
   where the argument in square brackets is optional.  The default
installation folder is the parent folder of the source folder.
